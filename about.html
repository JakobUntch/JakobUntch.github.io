	Thanks for checking out my website! <br> <br> As for a little bit about myself, I was born in London (Ontario) and moved to Waterloo for school back in 2022. 
	Ever since my childhood, I have always had a deep passion within the field of computing and engineering. 
	I could always be found tinkering with random electronic devices and figuring out the ways in which they work even at a young age. 
	This hobby has carried over to my adulthood, where I can often be found in my free time repairing old video game consoles, 
	creating new devices using micro-controllers or FPGAs, and building computers for friends and family. <br> <br>
	As for my future aspirations, I would love to work within the field of sustainable technology, since this industry will offer me the opportunity to 
	enrich the lifes of everyone on this Earth, and help reduce the devastation that climate change will bring upon us. I also have plans for a small business
	I am wanting to run throughout my years at Waterloo. If you are interested in knowing more, feel free to contact me!
